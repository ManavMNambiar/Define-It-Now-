1. BART:
BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) is a more advanced model for text generation and summarization tasks.
You can use the facebook/bart-large-cnn model, which often provides high-quality summaries.

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

2. T5:
T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) is another powerful model for text generation tasks, including summarization.
The t5-large or t5-3b models are particularly good for summarization.

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="t5-large")

3. Pegasus:
Pegasus is designed specifically for abstractive summarization and has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on many summarization benchmarks.
The google/pegasus-xsum model is a good choice.

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="google/pegasus-xsum")

4. Longformer:
For longer documents, Longformer is designed to handle longer context lengths.
The allenai/longformer-large-4096 model can be useful for summarizing lengthy texts.

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="allenai/longformer-large-4096")

5. Flan-T5:
An extension of T5, Flan-T5 models are fine-tuned with instruction-based prompts and can perform well on summarization tasks.
The google/flan-t5-large is a robust option.

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="google/flan-t5-large")
